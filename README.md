# US Medical Insurance Project
 
This project is based upon the Codecademy assignment in the Data Scientist: Machine Learning Career Path.

The project utilizes the US Medical Insurance dataset found on Kaggle.
Within the analysis, I answer the following questions: 
- Find out the average age of the patients in the dataset.
- Analyze where a majority of the individuals are from.
- Look at the different costs between smokers vs. non-smokers.
- Figure out what the average age is for someone who has at least one child in this dataset
- Find the average number of cihldren for different age groupings
